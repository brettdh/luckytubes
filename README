What is it?

LuckyTubes is a command-line utility to find, download, and rip music
from YouTube videos. Its main goals are simplicity, low development
overhead, and cross-platform usability, in that order. It resembles
clive, but it is targeted at playing music that just happens to have a
video on YouTube. It is a relatively thin wrapper over youtube-dl.

Usage 

LuckyTubes interprets all its command arguments as search terms
for YouTube videos. For example, luckytubes the way i are will
retrieve the first video on YouTube matching the search terms "the way
I are" (sans quotes), save it to ~/.luckytubes, extract the (probably
MP3) audio track with ffmpeg, and add the resulting MP3 to your Amarok
playlist.
