What is it?

LuckyTubes is a command-line utility to find, download, and rip music
from YouTube videos. Its main goals are simplicity, low development
overhead, and cross-platform usability, in that order. It resembles
clive, but it is targeted at playing music that just happens to have a
people don't have Python installed, and I am too lazy to generate
video on YouTube. Because cross-platform usability is a goal, normal
frozen bundles for Windows and Mac, LuckyTubes is compatible with
Jython 2.2.1 (will move to 2.5 when it's released).

Usage 

LuckyTubes interprets all its command arguments as search terms
for YouTube videos. For example, luckytubes the way i are will
retrieve the first video on YouTube matching the search terms "the way
I are" (sans quotes), save it to ~/.luckytubes, extract the (probably
MP3) audio track with ffmpeg, and add the resulting MP3 to your Amarok
playlist.
